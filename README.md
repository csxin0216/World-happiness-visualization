# World-happiness-visualization
使用 D3.js，参考 https://www.gapminder.org/fw/world-health-chart/ 的设计思路，实现的动态可交互bubble图.<br>

# How to run it:
1.Unzip the folder and open the folder in VSCode<br>
2.Search for the “Live Server” plugin in extensions and install it<br>
3.After installing the plugin, right-click the “OTOT_TaskB.html” file and select "Open with Live Server" to go to the corresponding browser page<br>
4.On the browser page, you can perform the following 5 Interactive Operations:<br>
(1)Select the appropriate x and y values and click “RESTART” to generate a dynamic bubble chart that changes with time, where the color represents different regions, and the size of the bubble represents the number of countries in each region.<br>
(2)Click “STOP” to pause at the current year.<br>
(3)Click “CONTINUE” to end the pause and continue the animation.<br>
(4)While in “stop” mode, drag the progress bar to the desired time and then click “CONTINUE” to continue from the current time.<br>
(5)Select new x and y values and click “RESTART” to generate a new dynamic bubble chart.<br>

# A Demo Video:
To get a better idea of the dynamic bubble chart and its interactive features, I've created a demo video that showcases its functionality, which can be found in the zip file named “demo.mp4”.
